s a payroll accountant, I would like to keep track of all of the employees in a list, so that I can add or subtract employees, when they come and go in the company.
  -Every employee that is currently employeed with the company will have their first and last name recorded on a csv sheet.
  -The csv sheet should be able to be imported into the program to calculate the total employee's wages.
 
------------------------------------------------------------
As a payroll accountant, I would like to track the monthly salaries, so that I can make sure the payroll is correct every month and the correct amount of taxes have been deducted.
  -Every employee imported from the CSV should have a base salary.

As a payroll accountant, I would like to track the total amount of sales, so that I can issue the correct commissions and bonuses that need to be delivered to the sales team and owner.
  -Each employee's total sales for the month is calculated to see if they made their quota.
  -If the employee's total sales exceed their quota, a bonus is issued.
  -If the total sales for all of the employees exceeds the monthly quota for the business, a bonus is issued to the owner.
